It’s the end of the year, and we’re throwing a celebration you won’t want to miss! Join us for our final meetup of 2024—a relaxed, holiday-themed gathering designed to bring the hacker and security community together for some fun, food, and festivities.

## Details
Join Pacific Hackers, DevSecCon, and OWASP Bay Area for our last meetup of 2024!

It's time to wind down the year and celebrate the holiday season with fellow hackers and security enthusiasts. No presentations, no pressure, just good vibes and good company.

## What to expect:

- Food & Drinks: Enjoy delicious food and drinks (thanks to our awesome sponsor, Snyk!)
- Optional CTF Fun: Feeling competitive? We'll have some fun CTF challenges set up for those who want to test their skills.
- Networking & Chill: Hang out with fellow hackers, share stories, and make new friends.

## Who should attend:

- Hackers of all skill levels
- Security enthusiasts
- Anyone interested in cybersecurity and a good time
